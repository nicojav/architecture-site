# Plans

This directory contains implementation plans created during development sessions.

Plans are typically created when:
- Implementing new features
- Major refactoring efforts
- Multi-step architectural changes

Each plan documents the approach, steps, and considerations before implementation begins.

## Guidelines

**Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.**
